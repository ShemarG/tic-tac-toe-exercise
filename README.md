# Tic-Tac-Toe: Redux

### Background
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe: Redux! It was a project inspired by the [The Marcy Lab School's](https://www.marcylabschool.org/the-team) assignment to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. I used this as a chance to further develop my OOP DOM manipulation skills without the aid of a framework.

### Overview
It is designed to be a standalone module that can be imported (with its CSS file) to any HTML page, as `TicTacToe.js` handles all of the markup for the game, just so long as the class is initialized and a DOM element that is to be the game area is passed into its constructor.

### Features
- **Win Highlighting**: Easily recognize when a win has ben achieved on the board as the winning move is highlighted in light green!
- **Reset at will**: Want to throw out an ongoing game? Want to switch players? The reset button makes it all possible! It clears the board and starts the game anew.
- **Score Keeping**: The scoreboard keeps track of wins for both players as well as draws.
- **Time Machine**: Forgot how a particular game went? You can always go back to that game by clicking "Show Previous Games" and clicking the game you want from the list next to that button.
